# MAGIC
# MAGIC Use this notebook to iterate on the code and configuration of your Agent.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By the end of this notebook, you will have 1+ registered versions of your Agent, each coupled with a detailed quality evaluation.  To interact with this Agent through the Playground or share with your business stakeholders for feedback, use the following notebooks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For each version, you will have an MLflow run inside your MLflow experiment that contains:
# MAGIC - Your Agent's code & config
# MAGIC - Evaluation metrics for cost, quality, and latency

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## üëâ START HERE: How to use this notebook
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We suggest the following approach to using this notebook to build and iterate on your Agent's quality.  
# MAGIC 1. Build an initial version of your Agent by tweaking the smart default settings and code in this notebook.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Vibe check & iterate on the Agent's quality to reach a "not embarassingly bad" level of quality.  Test 5 - 10 questions using MLflow Tracing & Agent Evaluation's quality root cause analysis to guide your iteration.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Use the later notebooks to share your Agent with stakeholders to collect feedback that you will turn into an evaluation set with questions/correct responses labeled by your stakeholders.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Use this notebook to Agent Evaluation using this evaluation set.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. Same as step 2, use MLflow Tracing & Agent Evaluation's quality root cause analysis to guide your iteration.  Iteratively try and evaluate various strategies to improve the quality of your agent and/or retriever.  For a deep dive on these strategies, view AI cookbook's [retrieval](https://ai-cookbook.io/nbs/5-hands-on-improve-quality-step-1-retrieval.html) and [generation](https://ai-cookbook.io/nbs/5-hands-on-improve-quality-step-1-generation.html) guides.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 6. Repeat step 3 to collect more feedback, then repeat steps 4 and 5 to further improve quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Important note:** Throughout this notebook, we indicate which cell's code you:
# MAGIC - ‚úÖ‚úèÔ∏è should customize - these cells contain code & config with business logic that you should edit to meet your requirements & tune quality.
# MAGIC - üö´‚úèÔ∏è should not customize - these cells contain boilerplate code required to load/save/execute your Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Cells that don't require customization still need to be run!  You CAN change these cells, but if this is the first time using this notebook, we suggest not doing so.*

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### üö´‚úèÔ∏è Install Python libraries
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You do not need to modify this cell unless you need additional Python packages in your Agent.

# COMMAND ----------

# Versions of Databricks code are not locked since Databricks ensures changes are backwards compatible.
# Versions of open source packages are locked since package authors often make backwards compatible changes
%pip install -qqqq -U \
  -r requirements.txt `# shared packages` \

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### üö´‚úèÔ∏è (Optional) Change Agent's shared storage location configuration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ** If you configured `00_shared_config`, just run this cell as-is.**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC From the shared configuration, this notebook uses:
# MAGIC * The Evaluation Set stored in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC * The MLflow experiment for tracking Agent verions & their quality evaluations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *These values can be set here if you want to use this notebook independently.*

# COMMAND ----------

from cookbook_utils.cookbook_config import AgentCookbookConfig
import mlflow

# Load the shared configuration
cookbook_shared_config = AgentCookbookConfig.from_yaml_file('./configs/cookbook_config.yaml')

# Print configuration 
cookbook_shared_config.pretty_print()

# MAGIC ## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate on the Agent's code & config to improve quality
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The below cells are used to execute your inner dev loop to improve the Agent's quality.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If you are creating this Agent for the first time, you will:
# MAGIC 1. Review the smart defaults provided in the Agent's code & configuration
# MAGIC 2. Vibe check the Agent for 1 query to verify it works
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We suggest the following inner dev loop:
# MAGIC 1. Run the Agent for 1+ queries or your evaluation set
# MAGIC 2. Determine if the Agent's output is correct for those queries e.g., high quality
# MAGIC 3. Based on that assessment, make changes to the code/config to improve quality
# MAGIC 4. üîÅ Re-run the Agent for the same queries, repeating this cycle.
# MAGIC 5. Once you have a version of the Agent with sufficient quality, log the Agent to MLflow
# MAGIC 6. Use the next notebooks to share the Agent with your stakeholders & collect feedback
# MAGIC 7. Add stakeholder's queries & feedback to your evaluation set
# MAGIC 8. üîÅ Use that evaluation set to repeat this cycle

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### ‚úÖ‚úèÔ∏è ‚öôÔ∏è Adjust the Agent's configuration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, we use the MLflow [ModelConfig](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/create-log-agent.html#use-parameters-to-configure-the-agent) primitive to parameterize your Agent's code with common settings you will tune to improve quality, such as prompts.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > *Note: Our template Agents use [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models, which are thin wrappers around Python dictionaries.  Pydantic allows us to define the initial parameters Databricks suggests for tuning quality and allows this notebook to validate parameters changes you make.*
# MAGIC > 
# MAGIC > *If you prefer, you can switch to using a native Python dictionary for parameterization.  Since MLflow ModelConfig only accepts YAML files or dictionaries, we dump the Pydantic model to a YAML file before passing it to MLflow ModelConfig.*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can (and often will need to) add or adjust the parameters in our template.  To add/modify/delete a parameter, you can either:
# MAGIC 1. Modify the Pydantic classes in `agent_code_templates`
# MAGIC 2. Create a Python dictionary in this notebook to replace the Pydantic class

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate the Agent's quality
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once you have modified the code & config to create a version of your Agent, there are 3 ways you can test it's quality.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each mode does the same high level steps:
# MAGIC 1. Log the Agent's code and config to an MLflow Run --> this captures your code/config should you need to return to this version later after modifying the notebook
# MAGIC 2. Runs the Agent for 1+ queries
# MAGIC 3. Allows you to inspect the Agent's outputs for those queries
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To get started, pick a mode and scroll to the relevant cells below.  If this is your first time, start with üÖ∞.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - üÖ∞ Vibe check the Agent for a single query
# MAGIC   - Use this mode in your inner dev loop to iterate and debug on a single query while making a change.
# MAGIC - üÖ± Evaluate the Agent for 1+ queries
# MAGIC   - Use this mode before you have an evaluation set defined, but want to test a version of the Agent against multiple queries to ensure your change doesn't cause a regression for other queries.
# MAGIC - üÖ≤ Evaluate the Agent using your evaluation set
# MAGIC   - Use this mode once you have an evaluation set defined.  It is the same as üÖ±, but uses your evaluation set that is stored in a Delta Table.

# MAGIC   - If you want to register a different version:
# MAGIC     - Go the MLflow experiment UI, click on the Run containing the Agent version, and find the Run ID in the Overview tab --> Details section.  
# MAGIC     - Your `model_uri` is `runs:/b5b9436a56544263a97ddd2293e6f422/agent` where `b5b9436a56544263a97ddd2293e6f422` is the Run ID.
